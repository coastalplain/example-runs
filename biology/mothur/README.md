The Mothur project was "initiated by Dr. Patrick Schloss and his software development team in the
Department of Microbiology & Immunology at The University of Michigan. This project seeks to develop
a single piece of open-source, expandable software to fill the bioinformatics needs of the microbial
ecology community. We have incorporated the functionality of `dotur`, `sons`, `treeclimber`, `s-libshuff`,
`unifrac`, and much more. In addition to improving the flexibility of these algorithms, we have added
a number of other features including calculators and visualization tools."
